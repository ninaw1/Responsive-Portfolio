            <p class="spacing">
            <img class="main-image" src="./assets/images/main-image.jpg" alt="Me!">I'm shy, please come say "Hi"! While coping with my shyness, I enjoy drawing in any and every possible form. On my days off, you may find me drawing somewhere quiet, or quietly appreciating anything that is pink and cute. Despite being just a tad bit introverted, I am also a dancer. Apart from finding me in complicated labyrinths concentrated with everything cute and pink, or drawing my heart away, you may find me dancing late night at workshops and classes.
            </p>
            <p class="spacing">Basically, I love everything to do with art, dance, and the color pink!
            </p>
            <p class="spacing">Aside from having an obsession with those listed items, I also have a frighteningly large collection of stuffed animals. They are my friends. The ones that comfort me, and the ones that are always there whenever I may need them. A soft hug from them is what I look forward to the most at the end of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="spacing">And yes, I am okay. I just really, really love stuffed animals. I love snuggling them, and cuddling them. It immediately brings warmth into my heart and makes me feel safe and protected. You should reslly try it out sometime. 
            </p>
            <p class="spacing">One last thing about me is that I am a closet nerd. I love playing video games, and anything nerdy. I often hide this aspect of myself, due to social interpretations, however I enjoy playing video games. This is just a little snippet about me, and there is much more to come!
